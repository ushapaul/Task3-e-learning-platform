As part of the CODTECH internship, Task 4 involves designing the front-end of an e-learning platform. The interface should include essential features such as course listing, progress tracking, and video embedding. The deliverable is a well-styled, interactive multi-page user interface. Interns are expected to store all their work-related code and files in a GitHub repository and maintain proper commenting practices within their code. A completion certificate will be provided at the end of the internship.
